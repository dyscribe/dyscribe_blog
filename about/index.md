My name is Kai. I'm a web dude from Hamburg, Germany. I currently work as project manager at [Jimdo](//www.jimdo.com) - a website builder with over 15 Million websites created so far.

I studied "information technologies" and "philosophy of media". I did several jobs from freelance web designer, social worker at the Youth Wellfare Office to passionate part time musician.

After all that, I ended up here blogging on things related to mind, code and design. For me to express, for you to enjoy...

If you like to get in contact you can reach me through mail, twitter, github and google plus, all linked somewhere around this site.
