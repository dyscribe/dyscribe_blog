My name is Kai. I'm web designer / developer from Hamburg, Germany. I currently work as project manager at [Jimdo](//www.jimdo.com) - a website builder with over 10 Million websites created so far. I also moderate agile retrospectives and other meeting formats there.  
Before I studied "information technologies" and "philosophy of media" and have been a social worker at the Youth Wellfare Office for quite a few years before my path lead me to Hamburg.

After all that, I ended up here blogging on things related to mind, code and design. For me to express, for you to enjoy...

If you like to get in contact you can reach me through mail, twitter, github and google plus, all linked somewhere around this site.
