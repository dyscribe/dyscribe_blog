[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dyscribe/dyscribe_blog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dyscribe/dyscribe_blog/)

This is the public repo of my blog, available at [dyscribe.com](https://dyscribe.com).

It contains a repsonsive [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) template, derived / built upon the [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes)
as well as all the assets and articles available there.

## Notes

> As this is my digital playground, this template has been strongly modified and crafted by best means and understanding. It was not intended or built to be easily customizable for other purposes or projects. It is fine to do so, just saying that this was not the scope.
If you are looking for a clean and customizable Jekyll Template, you might be better of with the [original version of this](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme).

## Collaboration

Collaboration is highly appreciated.
If you find bugs in the code, misspellings in articles, or security breaches feel free to open up a pull request.
